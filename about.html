    <p>This website was inspired by <em>Warframe</em>, a game known for its cool futuristic designs and creative world.
    I wanted to make something that shows my interest in the game and my own imagination, so I designed a new Warframe idea called <strong>Osiris</strong>.</p>

    <p>My goal was to create a place where I could show my concept through pictures, colors, and short descriptions, while learning how websites are made. 
      I built this project using <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> in Visual Studio Code, and I also used some image tools to design and edit my Warframe concept.
    Through this project, I learned how to organize a website, add different pages, and make things look neat and stylish. 
      It also helped me understand how creativity, design, and technology can all come together to bring an idea to life.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting Project Osiris! I hope you enjoy exploring my Warframe design concept as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
